# CLAUDE.md — Bullet-Hell Game

Living architecture contract. Update at the end of every session: what's real (built and verified) vs. still open.

## What this is
Keyboard-only bullet-hell. The player dodges as a soul inside a box (Undertale-style dodging only, no ACT/menus in battle). A UCN-style roster: the player sets each character's level 0–20 and all active characters attack at once. Geometric/minimal art. Personal hobby project.

## Stack
- TypeScript (strict), Phaser 3, Vite
- No physics engine: collision is hand-written shape math in `src/combat/Collision.ts`
- Vitest for pure logic; rendering verified in the browser
- Save: versioned JSON in localStorage
- Build gate: `npm run build` must pass (not just `tsc`)

## Commands
- `npm run dev`: dev server
- `npm run build`: production build (the gate)
- `npm test`: Vitest

## Architecture rules
1. Characters never import or reference each other. They communicate through typed events on `core/EventBus.ts`. Combos live only in `director/interactions.ts`, so adding a character never edits existing ones.
2. The Box is the coordinate frame. Bullets store box-local positions; `Box.toWorld` / `toLocal` convert. Moving, resizing or rotating the box transforms everything inside it.
3. Characters are config plus a small class. `<name>.config.ts` maps level bands to attacks, damage, speed, frequency. The class only holds behavior the config can't express. Level 0 = inactive.
4. The Director owns battle time and ticks every active character's schedule. Modes (`TimerMode`, `WaveMode`) only decide when the battle ends or what loads next.
5. All damage goes through `soul.damage({ amount, type })`. i-frames and KR poison are handled there and nowhere else.
6. Game logic runs on a fixed 60 Hz timestep, separate from rendering, so difficulty is frame-rate independent.
7. Collision, config lookup, damage, and scheduling are pure functions with unit tests. Phaser code only draws and reads input.
8. Bullets come from `BulletPool`; never `new Bullet()` inside the game loop.
9. Colors come from `render/theme.ts`. Each character owns one accent color; bullets must stay readable against the box at all levels.

## Locked game decisions
- Two modes, both time-based: fixed survival timer, and a scripted set of waves
- HP bar with i-frames; KR-style poison as a damage type; no one-hit mode; no healing pickups
- Shop: one passive and one active ability equipped; unlocks are abilities and cosmetics, never characters
- 5 characters at launch; Prism is #1; the rest are designed with Ian, not invented by Claude
- Keyboard only; no music yet; scoring decided later

## Characters
### Prism (cyan triangle) — pure dodging, no box effect
- Levels 1–5: single-direction volleys from box edges, slow, clear gaps
- Levels 6–14: beams split in two on hitting a box wall
- Levels 15–20: refraction prism appears in the box; beams passing through fan into three
- Emits: `beamFired`, `beamHitWall`

## Build order
1. Feel: scaffold, fixed timestep, soul movement, static box, test bullet, collision, HP + i-frames
2. Bullet system: pool, shapes, box-local coords, line/fan/ring/aimed patterns, debug spawn scene
3. Prism end to end: Character base, config format, registry
4. Director + Timer mode: roster toggles, battle start/end, results
5. Dynamic box: tweened resize/move/rotate, damaging walls, change events
6. Characters 2–5 + interactions
7. Wave mode
8. Shop, abilities, save
9. Polish and scoring

## Status
### Real (built and verified)
- Nothing yet. Repo not scaffolded.

### Open
- KR source: specific characters only, or general?
- Wave mode: hand-designed or generated?
- Shop currency source
- Timer length (guess 2–3 min), max HP, soul speed, hitbox size
- Scoring
- Characters 2–5
- Game name
